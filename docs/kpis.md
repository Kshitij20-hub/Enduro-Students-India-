# Operational KPIs — Enduro Student India (Reconstructed)

**Scope:** Practice sessions and event‑readiness activities prior to ESI 2019. Numbers reconstructed from notes and team memory to provide a transparent view of operational impact.

## Pit‑stop time trend (target ≤10s)
- Session 1: 15.2s
- Session 2: 14.1s
- Session 3: 13.5s
- Session 4: 12.8s
- Session 5: 12.0s
- Session 6: 11.3s
- Session 7: 10.8s
- Session 8: 10.2s
- Session 9: 10.0s (target achieved)

**Actions that drove improvement**
- Role cards and rota for fuel, tyres, brakes, suspension checks.
- Kitted pit toolboxes and pre‑staged consumables (fuel, rags, gloves).
- Standard work sheets: 10‑second checks with go/no‑go points.

## QA Gate adherence (pre‑run checks)
- Bolt/torque map, fluids, chain tension, brake lock test
- Start of programme: ~65% pass rate
- Pre‑event: ~94% pass rate
- Impact: fewer late fixes; more consistent scrutineering outcomes.

## Logistics readiness
- Transported as kit via train → re‑assembly in Pune workshop.
- Spares/consumables list prepared and labelled beforehand.
- Result: faster setup on arrival; reduced time-to-first test.

*Note:* These KPIs are reconstructed for portfolio clarity and should be read as indicative, not audited measurements.
